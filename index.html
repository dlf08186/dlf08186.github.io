					<H3> About the Founder & Company </H3>
						<P>Ladyloui's was founded by me because of my past history with eczema and sensitive skin. It bothered me that everything that was being given to me had a whole lot of chemicals or artificial ingredients in them, so I decided to start making my own products and eventually made a business out of it. The products I create are all Organic, Vegan, and are all created of natural occurrence. I do this to ensure the safety, health, and wellbeing of all of my customers and myself, and as an added bonus all of my products are handmade so you don't need to worry about the source or the authenticity. My mission and goal are to help others and I'm proud to be doing so through this platform.</P>
